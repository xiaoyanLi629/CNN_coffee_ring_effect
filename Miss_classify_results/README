Ten csv files are included in this folder, one file for each of the ten independently run CNN models. Each file includes the identification numbers for the misclassified images. For example, 11 means image number eleven in the testing folder of images (11.jpg) was misclassified. 0 means there were no images misclassified. The misclassification information for the last 200 models within each one of the ten independent CNN models were stored in the csv file.
